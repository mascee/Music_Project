## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based music recommendation system that predicts and recommends music based on XXX. 

## Problem Statement:
In today's digital music landscape, millions of songs are created and uploaded across various platforms. With such a vast amount of music, it becomes challenging for users, streaming platforms, and artists to classify and recommend music accurately based on genre. Traditional manual classification is subjective and time-consuming, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.

## Why Is This Problem Worth Solving?
1. Improved User Experience:
2. Artist Discovery and Marketing
3. Data-Driven Insights for Platforms:
4. Enhancing Music Exploration:

## Ethical Considerations
We are committed to ensuring compliance with copyright laws and ethical data usage standards in our project. The following key points address potential concerns regarding data usage and licensing:

### 1. **Dataset Selection and Licensing**
We have carefully selected publicly available and appropriately licensed datasets to train our models. The datasets used include:

- **[GTZAN Music Genre Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)**  
  - Citation: XXXX
  - Licensing: For research and academic purposes only.

Any additional datasets will be vetted to ensure fair use and compliance with licensing guidelines.

### 2. **API Usage Compliance**
To retrieve music-related features and metadata, we leverage public APIs such as:

- **Spotify Web API**  
  - Terms of Service: https://developer.spotify.com/terms
  - Usage: We retrieve only metadata such as tempo, key, and energy levels without storing or distributing copyrighted audio.

We ensure that our use of these APIs complies with the terms of service and includes proper attribution in our documentation.

### 3. **Data Usage Disclaimer**
This project is strictly for educational and research purposes. We do not distribute copyrighted music files, and all data sources comply with their respective licensing agreements.

**Disclaimer:**
This project is intended for educational and research purposes only. All data used complies with publicly available datasets, and no copyrighted materials are redistributed. The recommendations are based on feature analysis provided by legal sources such as Spotify API and public domain datasets.
```

### 5. **Responsible AI Use**
Our team is committed to transparency and responsible AI development by:

- Ensuring data privacy and security.
- Providing clear explanations of our recommendation models.
